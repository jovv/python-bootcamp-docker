# Exercise 3

Similar to exercise 2, we will run a python script in a docker container, but this time we will create our own image and container.

* Create a **Dockerfile** baesd on the python image you've used before
* In that Dockerfile you want to copy the python script into the image, and run that script as the default command to execute when the container is run
* Build the image
* Run the a container based on your image

Bonus: show the logs of the container
