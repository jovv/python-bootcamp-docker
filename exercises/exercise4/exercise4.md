# Exercise 4

In the `api.py` script is the code to run a python api. In the requirements.txt, you will find the requirements to run this. These can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

Build a Docker image, in which you install the requirements and run the api. If you did well, you should be able to see the app in your browser at` http://localhost:5000`.
